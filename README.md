# Documentation

Examples:
<h3>POST</h3>
/api/v1/eto/

<h3>POST/GET/DELETE</h3>
/api/v1/dataset/{dataset_id}

<h3>GET</h3>
/api/v1/dataset/{dataset_id}/analysis

<h3> Example usage </h3>

In order to use the aforementioned API, you need to fill out the input parameters corresponding to the requested ETO calculation.

Use POST /api/v1/dataset/{dataset_id} to upload your data to the database.
GET and DELETE requests with the same URL as previously mentioned are for fetching and deleting data from database, respectively.
